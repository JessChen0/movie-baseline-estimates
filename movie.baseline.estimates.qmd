## Global Baseline Estimates

### Approach

The purpose of this project is to experiment with the "Global Baseline Estimate" recommender algorithm. To implement the project, I will:

1.  Upload the Oscar 2026 nominated movies dataset I collected from previous assignment: <https://github.com/JessChen0/Movie-Ratings>
2.  Identify "user" and "movie" combinations missing ratings
3.  Write r code to score a rating prediction for a missing user/movie combination
4.  Double check by manually calculating the baseline estimate score
5.  Write further r code to compare would be missing ratings for a user and recommend highest score missing rating
